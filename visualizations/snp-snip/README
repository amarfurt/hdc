For the website to work the node server in /server must be running on localhost:8888.
The databases generated by the script in /database-gen must be in the directory where the server is run.
To use the database generation scripts run db_generator.py with an filename argument (the file contains a list of allowed rsnumbers, one per line).
The required python/nodejs libraries can all be installed with pip/npm. 

The website needs to be called with a base 64 encoded url in the url. This url is then used to retrieve the genome file. This functionality is not fully implemented but can be simulated for example by putting the genome file in the snp_db folder used by the nodejs file server.
The following html can be opened in a browser to generate the code for the url:

<html>
<script>
alert(btoa('http://localhost:8888/23andme.txt'));
</script>
</html>

just replace the url with whatever address you use to retrieve your file (any http server will do).
For the above address the code is aHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdDo4ODg4LzIzYW5kbWUudHh0
